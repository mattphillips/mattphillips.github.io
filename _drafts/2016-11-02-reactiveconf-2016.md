Last week was ReactiveConf making it's second appearance in Bratislava. The conference enjoyed great talks from tech icons, good food and free beer - the best formula for a successful conference.

Red Badger sent three of it's very own developers to enjoy the spoils of ReactiveConf and here is my top 5 talks from the week.

## Visualizing the data flow with Cycle.js

[André Staltz](https://twitter.com/andrestaltz) - Futurice

André began by discussing different DevTools available to the community for inspecting data, a là Redux DevTools, leading onto a demo of a [Cycle.js DevTool](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/tree/master/devtool) he made that shows the visualization of the dataflow graph between source streams and sink streams. We were then taken on a throughly enlightening journey into [Cycle.js](https://cycle.js.org/) and Observables with the aid of Lego.

## The Universality of Static Sites

[Mark Dalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish) - Culture Amp

To kick off his talk Mark discussed different approaches to rending [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) applications using universal/isomorphic rendering and client side rendering in a single page application.

This lead Mark to introduce a lesser-known third option using React to pre-render sites at build time, whether partially or fully, and the Webpack [plugin](https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin) he created to achieve this.

## The Age of Reason(ML)

Sean gave a very compelling introduction into [Reason(ML)](https://facebook.github.io/reason/) boasting the powerful type-checking, incredible tooling (the first language ever to separate syntax and semantics), fantastic performance (by replacing operating-system code and creating unikernel servers that boot in 50 milliseconds and weigh between 200KB-10MB), and truly unbelievable reach targeting browsers and native.

## What's Next? Exploring the future of React

[Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg) - ZEIT

Guillermo showed us [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now/) - a tool for deploying your JavaScript applications and services to the cloud with ease, speed and reliability, via one command `now` giving you a unique URL to the deployment.

This lead to Guillermo excitedly introducing the newly open-sourced [next.js](https://zeit.co/blog/next) - a small framework for server-rendered universal JavaScript webapps, built on top of React, Webpack and Babel.

## Elm and React in production

[Richard Feldman](https://twitter.com/rtfeldman) - NoRedInk

Richard talked about how to integrate, migrate and co-habit new technologies into existing codebases. He explained the approach taken at NoRedInk to initially adopt React before fully migrating over time.

However the story didn't end there - NoRedInk used same approach to add [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) into the mix. Leading to a migration to Elm where NoRedInk is now heavily using Elm and React side-by-side in production.

This is definitely a conference I would recommend, especially the after parties and ice bar! If you love \<React /> and Reactive Programming with other gems from the industry surfacing then ReactiveConf is for you.
