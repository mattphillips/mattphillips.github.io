# Who am I?

## [Wotcha!](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wotcha) I'm Matt Phillips a Software Engineer from London.

I completed my degree in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham and have since worked as a Software Engineer for BT and Football Radar. My interests lie in writing clean and elegant code, functional programming and web / mobile development. Outside of software I am an Arsenal FC fan (seeking a season ticket!) and a Football Manager enthusiast.

This blog is a personal platform where I will discuss various technical topics and give tutorials, on things I think are cool and whatever else is remaining on the mental stack.

Anything else you want to know, feel free to contact me on any of my social accounts.
